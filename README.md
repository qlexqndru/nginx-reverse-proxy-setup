# Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup

This repository contains scripts to automate the setup of Nginx as a reverse proxy on your server, with options for both SSL and non-SSL configurations.

## Overview

- **with-ssl**: Sets up Nginx as a reverse proxy with SSL encryption, using Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates.
- **without-ssl**: Configures Nginx as a reverse proxy without SSL, ideal for environments where SSL termination is handled elsewhere (e.g., Cloudflare).

## Getting Started
